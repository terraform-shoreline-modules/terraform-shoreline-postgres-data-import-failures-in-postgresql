### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Data Import Failures in PostgreSQL
---

This incident type refers to situations where there are issues encountered when importing data into PostgreSQL. This can lead to failures and errors that prevent the successful importation of data. Troubleshooting and resolving data import issues can be challenging and require a detailed understanding of the system and its configuration. Common causes of data import failures in PostgreSQL include issues with data formatting, configuration issues, and data integrity problems. Resolving these issues typically requires careful analysis of error messages and logs, as well as close collaboration between developers and database administrators.

### Parameters
```shell
export VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"

export DATABASE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"

export DESTINATION_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"

export TABLE_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export FILENAME="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if PostgreSQL service is running
```shell
service postgresql status
```

### Check PostgreSQL logs for any error messages
```shell
tail -n 100 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-${VERSION}.log
```

### Verify PostgreSQL configuration settings
```shell
sudo -u postgres psql -c "SHOW config_file;"
```

### Check the integrity of the data being imported
```shell
pg_dump ${DATABASE_NAME} > dump.sql

pg_restore --list dump.sql
```

### Verify the permissions and ownership of the file being imported
```shell
ls -l ${FILE_PATH}
```

### Check for any errors during the file transfer process
```shell
rsync -avz ${FILE_PATH} ${DESTINATION_PATH}
```

### Data formatting issues: One possible root cause of data import failures in PostgreSQL is issues with data formatting. This can occur when data is not properly formatted for the database, or when there are inconsistencies in the data that prevent it from being imported correctly.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Define variables

DB_NAME=${DATABASE_NAME}

TABLE_NAME=${TABLE_NAME}

FILE_PATH=${FILE_PATH}



# Check file encoding

FILE_ENCODING=$(file -b --mime-encoding $FILE_PATH)

if [[ $FILE_ENCODING != "utf-8" ]]; then

  echo "ERROR: File encoding is not utf-8"

  exit 1

fi



# Check file formatting

pgfutter --db $DB_NAME --table $TABLE_NAME $FILE_PATH

if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then

  echo "ERROR: Failed to import data"

  exit 1

fi



echo "SUCCESS: Data imported successfully"

exit 0


```

## Repair

### Fix the data format in the file being imported so it's compatible with the target PostgreSQL database
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Get the filename and target PostgreSQL database name as arguments

filename=${FILENAME}

database=${DATABASE_NAME}



# Check if the file exists

if [ ! -f $filename ]; then

    echo "File $filename not found!"

    exit 1

fi



# Check if PostgreSQL is running

if ! pg_isready -q; then

    echo "PostgreSQL is not running!"

    exit 1

fi



# Fix the data format

sed -i 's/\r//' $filename



# Import the data into PostgreSQL

psql -d $database -c "COPY ${TABLE_NAME} FROM '$filename' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;"


```
